      "HCP Group has a long history of providing honorary professional services St. Xavier's High School, Loyola Hall, Ahmedabad. The design brief was Interior Design for the new auditorium space “for varied types of performances” and one that can accommodate a large proportion of the 1,200 pupils. 
       Our key design aim was to ensure enough flexibility to accommodate a range of school activities and stage performances. 
        We also needed to make sure that the fixtures and fitting were durable enough to withstand expected wear and tear of a bustling school environment.
        The lighting and sound systems were designed to allow for different configurations. " </p>

      <p> I was completely shocked when I got to know that I've won the first prize in my Inter School debate on environmental pollution.
         It was the second time when I participated in debate competition. At the time when I participated for the very first time so I didn't secure any position in this competition,
          At that time I felt a little sad but I decided that I'd do more hard work and I will participate again and I guess that I took the right decision to participate again,
           Also I learnt that hard work always pays off because At my first participation, 
           I was not concerned towards this competition but when I faced failure then It inspired me to do more hard work and because of that I have gotten this prize,
            My parents are very proud of me and they have gifted me a cycle for my achievement and now I have known that hard work is most important to achieve success.

    (My school is a very big one and it has a very modern canteen. It is perhaps the most popular place in the school. It becomes very busy during the break times very difficult to find a seat to sit on during those times, so we have to stand and eat.

    Our school canteen is very well equipped. One can buy almost every kind of snack there, like samosas, chips, sandwiches, sweet, cakes etc. They are prepared in very hygienic surroundings by our school cook, and tables to sit on and eat, and ovens to keep the food warm. There is also a soda fountain which is Very popular among the older students.
    
    All the students love to sit in the canteen and discuss the events of the day. The noise level is always very high in the canteen as everyone is shouting to make himself heard. There are notice boards and suggestion boxes which all students are freely. There is also a separate enclosure for teachers. The cook charges very reasonable rates from us.
    
    I think that the school canteen is my favorite place in the school. I always enjoy myself there, and look forward to the recess when I can rush to the canteen with my friends.
